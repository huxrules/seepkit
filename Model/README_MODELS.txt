Where are the models?

Github has a file size limitation of 100MB and the weights file is 600MB by itself. 
These files can be found on box.com: https://app.box.com/s/zgu9nh01l76udxyxyr62xi3sx6svylxi
Download these files:

huxlabs_seepkit_binary_classifier_gen0.h5

And put them in the Model directory from the github clone.
